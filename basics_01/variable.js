const emailid="aditi@gmail.com";
// after using const we can't change the variables value.
let address="jamshedpur";
// we prefer let over var , as var does not have scope block. i.e. if we use "i" in to for loops then one of the loop will affect the other.
 var id="1234";
//  not prefered
console.table([address,emailid,id]);
// console.table is used to print several values at the same time . without using console.log repetively.
